# Morpheus testnets
This is the official repository containing all the [Desmos](https://github.com/desmos-labs/desmos) testnets' data.

> The latest testnet is `morpheus-apollo-1`

All the data is grouped inside different subfolders named after the testnets themselves.

In each subfolder you will find: 
- a `genesis.json` file containing the genesis of that testnet
- a `README.md` file, containing the details of the testnet

If you want to know how to join a testnet, please read our guide on [how to become a Desmos validator](https://docs.desmos.network/validators/setup.html). 

Also, if you decide to become a validator, you will be able to earn periodic rewards thanks to our [Desmos Validator Program](https://medium.com/desmosnetwork/introducing-the-new-desmos-validator-program-1782d3eaa98f).
